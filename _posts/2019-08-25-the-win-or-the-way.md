Today the American Go Association published an article I wrote. It's a reflection on an older article published in the Buddhist journal, *Tricycle: The Buddhist Review*. Bill Cobb, a well-known figure in the American go scene, leans on his love of go and a lifetime of scholarship as a professor of philosophy, to reflect on go as a path to enlightenment.

The AGA article can be found [here](https://www.usgo.org/news/2019/08/the-win-or-the-way-finding-meaning-in-the-game-of-go/).
