Below you'll find a video that demonstrates a small application that I developed in [Codea](https://codea.io) as a way to explore some important concepts that I'd like to master and then apply to future development, be it in games or in data and algorithm visualization.

To make curves, I took a close look at how Bezier curves are implemented. In particular, I found [this site](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/) to be a gem (Thanks @TheRealPomax !).

The Fibonacci spiral and grid were just a way to bring some focus to the video. The application in action is much more free form - you can draw and adjust, delete control points, snap, or not, to the grid, and trigger the downpour of blue balls.

Finally, I did not want to just draw curves, but I wanted them to be physics bodies. This is where there's application value going forward. I want to use a utility program like this to help write code for physics terrains in games, be it predefined scenes, or perhaps used in infinite 2D scrolling scenarios. We'll see where it goes...

Thanks!
