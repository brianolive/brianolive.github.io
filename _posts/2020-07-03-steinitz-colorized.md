After seeing a recent article in The Guardian, [here](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/09/colour-allows-us-to-understand-in-a-deeper-sense-hitler-churchill-and-others-in-a-new-light), and following [Marina Amaral](https://marinamaral.com) on Twitter and seeing her excellent colorization, I decided to give it a go. Here's my best result to date: the [first world champion of chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz), Wilhelm Steinitz (1836-1900).

I found [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwoCD1LF3hA) by Zoe Martin to be very helpful in understanding the basics of the layering technique used to colorize photos.
