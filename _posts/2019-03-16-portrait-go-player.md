Some years ago, [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com) was generous enough to create this portrait of a good friend of mine. To this day, Tanaka-san ans I still meet up every week to play Go. We've kept this up for over 15 years now.

Thanks Michael for the portait and for the (So Simple)[https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) Jekyll theme that powers this web site!
