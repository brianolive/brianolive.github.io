Ideally, when my code is posted on [Crucible](https://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible) for review, it meets our coding standard, the need for comments and revision is minimal, and I and the reviewers are quickly on to new development. Unfortunately, there are times when <!--more--> this is not the case. Even more unfortunate is when I repeat some of the same less-than-desireable coding patterns.

The idea of 'code smelting' is to try to collect examples of these sub-optimal 'ores' of code, present them as [CodePens](https://codepen.io), allow viewers to click and see the improved code, and even perhaps discuss the merits and demerits, exceptions and other considerations that play into how the code in question should be written.
