A collection of small video clips showing some of my guitar playing, drawing, and any other thing I decide to record. Enjoy!

### Why

I decided to post videos of various things that I've been working on, whether it be a snippet of a guitar tune, or a digital drawing. These posts are more a 'progress journal' of sorts, and less a polished presentation of awesomeness. It's motivating to try to reach a goal, however small or simple, and post your progress. Even if you are your only audience.
